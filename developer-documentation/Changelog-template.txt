Web of Trust Version 0.4.4 build0018
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK (detailed changelog is below):

Summary blah blah. Blah blah reference to link [1].

Outlook blah blah.

TESTING

Make sure to backup the WebOfTrust directory (located in the directory
Freenet is installed to) before you use this!

Easy high level testing:
- Check the Community / Statistics page for unusual stuff. E.g.:
  - Data loss, e.g. decreasing count of own identities, non-own
    identities or trust values as compared to your database before
    installation of the testing version.
  - High count of "Failed files" at the Identity file queue / Identity
    file processor section.
  - No significant progress in average downloaded / queued / processed
    identity XML files  even after a day of uptime.

Tedious low level testing:
- Check "freenet-latest.log" for ERRORs of plugins.WebOfTrust.*
  You can filter for this by configuring logging as:
  - Set "Minimum priority to log messages at" to "NONE".
  - Set "Detailed priority thresholds" to "plugins.WebOfTrust:ERROR".
    Now any logging except WoT errors is disabled.
  Besides you should probably increase "Log rotation interval" to
  "48HOUR" (yes, no S in HOUR), the default is very low, 1 hour IIRC.
  Before you report anything from the log file make VERY sure to review
  it for private data! It might even contain the secret insert URIs of
  your identities!

DOWNLOAD

Until it has been shipped with a Freenet release this build is available
using "WebOfTrust Testing Versions" at "Configuration / Plugins" of a
standard Freenet node.
You must unload the regular WoT first!
