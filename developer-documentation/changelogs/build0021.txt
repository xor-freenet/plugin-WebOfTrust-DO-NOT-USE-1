Web of Trust Version 0.4.5 build0021
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK (detailed changelog is below):

This is a maintenance release which adds new seed identities and removes
inactive ones.
This should speed up bootstrapping for new users.


There hasn't been a release in a long time because I was and am still
busy with developing the big IdentityFetcher-rewrite release,
it's currently 85 branches long.

ArneBab has rightfully told me that not doing releases until the rewrite
is finished would be taking too long and I should do releases meanwhile.

Hence from now on I'll try to do small, self-contained feature releases
more frequently.
I'll not promise a fixed release schedule because I have been bad at
date estimates in the past so I should rather do none.


The next thing which I will consider for a release is updating the
translations from Transifex.


CHANGELOG - prefixed with the bugtracker issue number:

- 0000001: title_of_issue_1.............................................
           more_lines_of_title..........................................
  
  Blah.
  Blah.

Thanks to:
  - ArneBab for motivating me to do this release!
