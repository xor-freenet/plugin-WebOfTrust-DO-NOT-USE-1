Web of Trust Version 0.4.5 build0021
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK (detailed changelog is below):

This is a maintenance release which adds new seed identities and removes
inactive ones.
This should speed up bootstrapping for new users.


There hasn't been a release in a long time because I was and am still
busy with developing the big IdentityFetcher-rewrite release,
it's currently 85 branches long.

ArneBab has rightfully told me that not doing releases until the rewrite
is finished would be taking too long and I should do releases meanwhile.

Hence from now on I'll try to do small, self-contained feature releases
more frequently.
I'll not promise a fixed release schedule because I have been bad at
date estimates in the past so I should rather do none.


The next thing which I will consider for a release is updating the
translations from Transifex.


CHANGELOG:

- [Usability] Seed identities: Add new ones, remove inactive ones

  This should speed up bootstrapping for new users.

  Added:
  - Adilson_Lanpo (suggested by ArneBab)
  - ArneBab
  - HieronymusCH (suggested by ArneBab)

  If you're one of the above, please do not turn off trust list
  publishing in WoT's settings, otherwise your seed identity
  wouldn't be of any use.

  And your identity will now publish 100 captchas per day instead of 10.
  Don't worry - this likely will not mean much more traffic:
  WoT does not prefer seed identities when displaying captchas,
  the seed identities are just downloaded first and then other identities
  will be downloaded from their trust lists.
  So if new users keep running WoT for some time before they solve
  captchas then they will get captchas from other identities as well, not
  just the seeds.

  But if you wish to be removed as a seed feel free to let me know!
  
  Removed because they haven't been active in a long time:
  - operhiem1
  - toad_
  - zidel

  Thanks to ArneBab for providing the initial patch!


Thanks to:
  - ArneBab for motivating me to do this release!
